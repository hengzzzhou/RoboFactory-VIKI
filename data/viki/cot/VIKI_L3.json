The trajectory planning involves determining the sequence of movements for each robot to successfully lift the pot.\n\n1. **Identify the Pot's Position**: The pot is located in the center of the workspace, and both robots need to coordinate to lift it.\n\n2. **Determine the Trajectory for Each Robot**:\n   - **Your Trajectory**: The arm closest to the camera (your arm) needs to move towards the pot, grip it, and lift it upwards. The trajectory points are chosen to reflect this movement.\n   - **Partner's Trajectory**: The other arm needs to coordinate similarly, moving towards the pot, gripping it, and lifting it upwards. The trajectory points for the partner reflect this coordinated movement.\n\n3. **Coordinate Points**:\n   - **Your Trajectory Points**: Start from a position near the pot, move closer to grip it, and then lift upwards.\n   - **Partner's Trajectory Points**: Similarly, start from a position near the pot, move closer to grip it, and then lift upwards.\n\nThe final answer provides the specific pixel coordinates for each step in the trajectory for both robots.\n</think>\n<answer>\n[[[117, 139], [107, 147], [98, 143], [95, 130], [99, 108]], [[43, 122], [52, 127], [63, 130], [66, 117], [66, 105]]]\n</answer>"
