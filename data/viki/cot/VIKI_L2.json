This involves moving the robot close to the oven and interacting with it to gather information or perform a specific task.\n\n3. **Robot Capabilities**: The available robot is the unitree_go2, which is a quadrupedal robot known for its agility and stability. It can perform actions such as Move, Push, and Interact.\n\n4. **Action Planning**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use the \"Move\" action to navigate the robot (R1) to the oven. This positions the robot close enough to perform further interactions.\n   - **Step 2**: Use the \"Interact\" action to examine or interact with the oven. This could involve checking its status, opening it, or any other interaction needed to complete the examination task.\n\n5. **Constraints and Considerations**: The robot's actions are limited to Move, Push, and Interact. Given the task, only Move and Interact are relevant. The narrow space requires precise movement, which the unitree_go2 is capable of handling.\n</think>\n\n<answer>[{\"step\": 1, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Move\", \"oven\"]}}, {\"step\": 2, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Interact\", \"oven\"]}}]</answer>"

The focus is on the drawer, which is part of the task description.\n\n2. **Task Understanding**: The task is to observe the space around the drawer. This implies that the robot needs to move to the drawer and interact with it, possibly to open it or inspect it.\n\n3. **Robot Capabilities**: The available robot, R1 (unitree_go2), can perform the actions: Move, Push, and Interact. It cannot directly open or close objects, but it can interact with them.\n\n4. **Plan Development**:\n   - **Step 1**: Use the \"Move\" action to navigate R1 to the drawer. This positions the robot to observe or interact with the drawer.\n   - **Step 2**: Use the \"Interact\" action to engage with the drawer. This could involve nudging or inspecting it, fulfilling the task requirement to observe the space around it.\n\n5. **Constraints**: The robot can perform only one action per time step, and the actions must be within its capabilities.\n</think>\n\n<answer>[{\"step\": 1, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Move\", \"drawer\"]}}, {\"step\": 2, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Interact\", \"drawer\"]}}]</answer>"

This involves \"stompy\" securing the tomato with its end effector.\n   - **Step 4**: Use the \"Move\" action again to position \"stompy\" near the rack where the tomato needs to be placed.\n   - **Step 5**: Use the \"Place\" action to release the tomato onto the rack, completing the task.\n\n4. **Constraints**: Each step involves only one action per robot, and the sequence must logically follow the task requirements.\n</think>\n\n<answer>[{\"step\": 1, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Move\", \"tomato\"]}}, {\"step\": 2, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Reach\", \"tomato\"]}}, {\"step\": 3, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Grasp\", \"tomato\"]}}, {\"step\": 4, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Move\", \"rack\"]}}, {\"step\": 5, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Place\", \"rack\"]}}]</answer>"

This involves object manipulation and movement.\n\n3. **Robot Capabilities**: \n   - R1 ('fetch') is suitable for tasks requiring dexterity and mobility, such as moving and placing objects.\n   - R2 ('unitree_h1') is designed for human-like tasks, suitable for reaching and grasping objects.\n\n4. **Plan Development**:\n   - **Step 1**: R1 moves to the plate, and R2 moves to the cabinet.\n   - **Step 2**: R1 reaches for the plate, and R2 reaches for the cabinet.\n   - **Step 3**: R1 grasps the plate, and R2 opens the cabinet.\n   - **Step 4**: R1 moves to the kitchen work area, and R2 moves to the bread.\n   - **Step 5**: R1 places the plate on the kitchen work area, and R2 reaches for the bread.\n   - **Step 6**: R2 grasps the bread.\n   - **Step 7**: R2 moves to the plate.\n   - **Step 8**: R2 places the bread on the plate.\n\n5. **Action Primitives**: Each robot performs one action per step, using available primitives like Move, Reach, Grasp, Place, and Open.\n</think>\n\n<answer>[{\"step\": 1, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Move\", \"plate\"], \"R2\": [\"Move\", \"cabinet\"]}}, {\"step\": 2, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Reach\", \"plate\"], \"R2\": [\"Reach\", \"cabinet\"]}}, {\"step\": 3, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Grasp\", \"plate\"], \"R2\": [\"Open\", \"cabinet\"]}}, {\"step\": 4, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Move\", \"kitchen work area\"], \"R2\": [\"Move\", \"bread\"]}}, {\"step\": 5, \"actions\": {\"R1\": [\"Place\", \"kitchen work area\"], \"R2\": [\"Reach\", \"bread\"]}}, {\"step\": 6, \"actions\": {\"R2\": [\"Grasp\", \"bread\"]}}, {\"step\": 7, \"actions\": {\"R2\": [\"Move\", \"plate\"]}}, {\"step\": 8, \"actions\": {\"R2\": [\"Place\", \"plate\"]}}]</answer>"
